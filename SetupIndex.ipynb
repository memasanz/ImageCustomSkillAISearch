    "# Azure AI Search with Azure AI Vision multimodal embeddings for text-to-image queries\n",
    "\n",
    "As a scenario, this code shows you an approach for text-to-image vector queries. As a technical sample, it demonstrates how to call a custom embedding model for situations where you want models other an Azure OpenAI or OpenAI for vectorization. The multimodal embeddings used in this sample are provided by [Azure AI Vision 4.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/image-retrieval) and the [Image Retrieval REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/computervision/image-retrieval) which supports built-in vectorization of images. \n",
    "\n",
    "For indexing, the pattern uses a custom skill to wrap an Azure function app used to call the Image Retrieval API. Provisioning of this function app and custom skill is fully automated and included as a step in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function app is also used during queries, as the vectorizer. A vectorizer specifies which embedding model to use for vectorizing a text query string. As always, it's strongly recommended that query vectorization is performed using the same embedding model used for document vectorization during indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal), any region and tier, but we recommend Basic or higher for this workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [Azure Blob storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create), used as the data source during indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd), used to deploy an Azure function app and Azure AI Vision in your Azure subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [Azure Python SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-search-documents/?view=azure-python-preview) for indexer-driven indexing and vector query operations."
